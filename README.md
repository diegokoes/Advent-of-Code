In this repository I will be archiving all my solutions to the *Advent Calendar* of programming challenges that is [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/about).

2025 is my first time doing the challenges and doing them as they come out, after that I plan to go back to other years and do those too if I find it fun.

All the challenges I'm going to first solve in the languages I am more familiar with [ JavaScript | Java | Python ] and then maybe revisit them in the future to try in other languages as learning practice.
